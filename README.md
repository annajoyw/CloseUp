## What is Joy Journal? 
Joy Journal is an MVC built to help connect users to each other and their feelings by encouraging them to journal. I chose to develop this journaling platform because I have noticed that feelings and emotions are often disregarded by society in places such as school, work, and even in relationships. With Joy Journal I hope to provide a space for people to be honest with themselves and others about how they feel.
